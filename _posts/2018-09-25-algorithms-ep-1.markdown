## What is an Algorithm? ##
An algorithm is fundamentally a finite set of exact instruction to find a solution to a problem, not necessary a programming problem. It can be of any type. In this tutorial series, we will learn about different types of algorithms to solve different types of computational problems.

An algorithm must show the following characteristics:
+ It must serve correct result
+ It must finish executing within finite amount of time
+ It is feasible to represent the algorithm with using pseudocode, flow chart, code etc.

Pythagorean theorem:
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Hypothesis of logistic regression:
$h_\theta(x) = \Large\frac{1}{1 + \mathcal{e}^{(-\theta^\top x)}}$
{% endraw %}

## Design & Analysis of Algorithms
We will perform analysis on algorithms to find/predict the cost of it in terms of resources and performance. Then we will design an algorithm which reduces cost.
