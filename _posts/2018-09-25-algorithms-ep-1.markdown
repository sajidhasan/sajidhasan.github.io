## What is an Algorithm? ##
An algorithm is fundamentally a finite set of exact instruction to find a solution to a problem, not necessary a programming problem. It can be of any type. In this tutorial series, we will learn about different types of algorithms to solve different types of computational problems.

An algorithm must show the following characteristics:
+ It must serve correct result
+ It must be finished executing within reasonable amount of time
+ It is feasible to represent the algorithm with using pseudocode, flow chart, code etc.

There are three very basic goals of an algorithm. First, the algorithm must produce correct results, it must terminate within a reasonable time and the algorithm performance.

## Design & Analysis of Algorithms
We will perform analysis on algorithms to find/predict the cost of it in terms of resources and performance. Then we will design an algorithm which reduces cost.
