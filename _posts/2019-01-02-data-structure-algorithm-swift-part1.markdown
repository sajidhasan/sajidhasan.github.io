## What is a Collection?
As its name suggest, collection is essentially a group of things such as a collection of books, a collection of toys etc.
When we say "collection", it is not necessary for the elements of that collection to be in a particular order. Thus, we cannot
establish a serial in a collection.

Collections are not used in a programming language directly but there are several extensions of collections. These extensions
resembles many data structures because of different types of rules applied on the collections.
