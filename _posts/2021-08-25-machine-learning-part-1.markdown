### Definition

**Arthur Samuel** first coined the term **Machine Learning** . Accroding to him machine learning is

> "The field of study that
gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
programmed."

Tom Mitchell (1998) provides a more modern definition.

> “A
computer program is said to learn from experience E with
respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if
its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
experience E.”

Example -

Playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
