I have done many projects during my student life. Some are for academic purposes and some are for implementing my learning.
Most of my projects are web based. I also have some experience in Mobile App Development.

### Lyric Finder
---
**Lyric Finder** is an app where user can **search for lyrics** of the popular songs. The homepage shows **latest top 20 songs with a link to view the lyrics.**

**Live link:** [https://sajid-finds-lyric.herokuapp.com](https://sajid-finds-lyric.herokuapp.com)

**Github link:** [https://github.com/sajidhasan/lyric-finder](https://github.com/sajidhasan/lyric-finder)

The site might take a few moment to load for the first time since it is hosted in **Heroku**.

The technology stack that was used in this project are following:
* **ReactJS**
* **Context API**
* **Axios**
* **Bootstrap**
* **Fontawesome**
* **Musixmatch API** 
* **Heroku**

The lyric that this app shows is not the whole lyrics. It is because a non-commercial Musixmatch API is used to get the lyrics. This app is currently hosted in Heroku.
